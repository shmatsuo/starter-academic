# summary: "This is a short presentation at the session: Not Your Average White Paper: Academic Research on Blockchains."
abstract: "After the introduction of the blockchain technology by the Bitcoin paper, many theoretical researches have been conducted to analyze the security of blockchain technology beyond the scope of cryptography and distributed computing. However, the security of blockchain technology and protocols are more complicated than we think, because is consists of many factors. In this talk, such factors in securing blockchain technology and blockchain-based system are explained. Then we explore the research challenges with revisiting distributed consensus used in blockchain technology. This talk focuses on permissionless blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum."
