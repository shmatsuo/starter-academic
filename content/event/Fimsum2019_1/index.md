# summary: "This is a short presentation at the session: Not Your Average White Paper: Academic Research on Blockchains."
abstract: "Crypt-asset exchanges are suffering from incessant hacks, losing a decent amount of crypto-assets of their customers. While it is imperative to enhance the security of the system as a whole, including functions outside of the blockchain, now is the time to learn a lesson from past incidents and to find out the root cause of the issue. Where does the risk lie? What countermeasures should we take? Experts in both theory and practice who have been involved in the international standardization of the exchange security for more than one and a half years will present a prescription to improve the trust in the ecosystem."
