abstract="Pairings on elliptic curves over finite fields are crucial for constructing various cryptographic schemes. The $\eta$Tpairing on supersingular curves over GF(3n) is particularly popular since it is efficiently implementable. Taking into account the Menezes-Okamoto-Vanstone (MOV) attack, the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) in GF(36n) becomes a concern for the security of cryptosystems using $\eta$Tpairings in this case. In 2006, Joux and Lercier proposed a new variant of the function field sieve in the medium prime case, named JL06-FFS. We have, however, not yet found any practical implementations on JL06-FFS over GF(36n). Therefore, we first fulfill such an implementation and we successfully set a new record for solving the DLP in GF(36n), the DLP in GF(36{\textperiodcentered}71) of 676-bit size. In addition, we also compare JL06-FFS and an earlier version, named JL02-FFS, with practical experiments. Our results confirm that the former is several times faster than the latter under certain conditions.",
