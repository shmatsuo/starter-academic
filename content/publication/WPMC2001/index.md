abstract: "ITS (intelligent transport systems), that combine travelling by motor vehicle, are on the horizon. Many services have been proposed that will require payment from moving vehicles. However, when we try to use the existing payment schemes, we encounter problems that are caused by the wireless communication system. In this paper, we propose a new electronic ticket scheme that solves the problems of the existing schemes, and is efficient enough for use with ITS. Our scheme does not uses a digital signature, but a hash function. Thus, our payment protocol is much faster than existing schemes."
